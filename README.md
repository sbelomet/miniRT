### What to do

We made a ratraging engine in C using the minilibX, 42's very simple graphics library. It takes in a special file that gives all the necessary information about what is in the scene (ambiant light, lights, camera, shapes) and the renders the scene using a raytracing algorithm

### Usage

Prerequisites: This was coded on Mac, some graphical elements may not work on other systems
1. `make`
2. `./miniRT <scene.rt>` (scenes available in `scenes/`)
